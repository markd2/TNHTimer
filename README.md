# TNH Timer

Hello!  Welcome to my quick little pr√∂ject!  I've recently (Early July, 2017), been
using [The Now Habit](http://www.neilfiore.com/now-habit/) to "unschedule" my work
day.   (I recommend getting the dead-trees version if you're interested.  The iBooks
version doesn't flow very well, plus the parts when applying TNH are kind of hard use
in electronic form.)

### TL;DR

A quick iPhone timer geared to how I track time using _The Now Habit_'s unschedule.


### Boring Chatter

I juggle my full-time (paying) job at the Ranch with two substantial
side-projects, and generally feel overwhelmed, trapped by obligations
and having to Work All The Time.  And also procrastinate by burning
time on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsStandingUp/), facebook,
the twitters, slack, etc.  The Now Habit has helped me so far in
carving out chunks of focused, distraction-free work; coupled with
"yes, I'm going to spend time on things I really **want** to do, such [as
write with fountain pens](http://reddit.com/r/fountainpens/) and [make
bad electronic music](http://soundcloud.com/borkware)

In fact, it's this general sense of freedom that's letting me let myself make
this little utility.  Otherwise I'd be browsing dank memes and filing Xcode
bug reports instead of writing READMEs and making `.gitignore` files.


## What it does

This is my highly detailed software behavior architecture document:

* Start the timer. 
* It makes a sound after 30 minutes (the minimum amount of "focused time" to count as
   having done work). 
* The timer keeps running until you tell it to stop.  
* It'll tell you how much time you spent on this Activity, along with the start time.

This is perfect for copying into my analog unschedule.  I use a [Leuchtturm-1917 Bullet Journal](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/leuchtturm1917-bullet-journal-a5-notebook-black) dot-grid,
and fountain pens - multiple ink colors for different activities, augmented with a pencil.


## TODO

It works! But of course could be made better.  See the [Kornborn projects](https://github.com/markd2/TNHTimer/projects)
